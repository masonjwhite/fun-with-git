# Fun With Git

## Summary/Motivation

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

This repository was a simple exploration of different Git workflows (Mostly rebasing and squash commits). It is not intended to serve a purpose other than a playground for experimenting with new Git workflows.
